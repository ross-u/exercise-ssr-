# Exercise - SSR

<br>

Create a new View file named `About.jsx` used to render the About page:

- Create a new route for `GET` request with the endpoint `/about`:

- It should `res.render()` a newly created view file, from `views/About.jsx`.
- In the newly created template file `About.jsx`:
  - Create an `h1` with your name.
  - Create an `h2` with your favourite book/movie/serie quote.
  - Add an image from [giphy](https://giphy.com/) that you like.
